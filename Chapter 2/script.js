let name = "chitresh"; //we can use single quotes or double quotes but single quotes is a better practice
console.log(name);

//now i know that i used double quotes because i have that c++ habit
//also your variable names should be meaningful
//also your variable name cannot be a javascript keyword 
//it cannot start with a number (1name)
//cannot contain a space or a python
//best practice is to declare each variable on a single line
