synchronous -> synchronous is waiting for one task to complete and then moving to the next task
asycnchronous nature -> async nature is we can start one task and move to the next task without completing the first task 

This can make your programs more efficient and responsive, especially when dealing with operations that might take some time to complete, like fetching data from a server or reading a file.
