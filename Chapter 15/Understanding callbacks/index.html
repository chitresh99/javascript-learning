    <li>
        A callback is a function.
    </li>
    <li>
        It gets passed as an argument to another function.
    </li>
    <li>
        The main function executes its task.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the main function completes its task, it calls (or "callbacks to") the provided callback function to execute additional code.
    </li>
    
        <h2>
        When the main task is completed, it uses the callback function to notify you and execute any 
        additional code you've provided in the callback. This way, you can coordinate and
         sequence tasks that depend on each other or handle asynchronous operations effectively.
